               <div>
               <p> DJ Zinhle is unarguably the biggest and most prominent female DJ in South Africa. The beautiful mother of one and businesswoman is a genius on the wheels of steel. She has spawned some of the biggest hits that rocked the airwaves over the years. Teaming up with Busiswa, she released the hit “My Name Is,” and we all could not stop singing it. She has since returned with many more hits, including “Umlilo” with Rethabile Khumalo and, of course, “Ndlovu” with Lloyiso.</p>

               <div>
                <p>DBN Gogo is a force to reckon with. In a few years, the talented Mzansi female Disc Jockey has reached heights many only dream of. Gogo has performed on some of the world’s biggest stages and festivals, including Coachella. She has also traveled the world doing what she does best. She first gained significant recognition during the lockdown; she has kept herself in the spotlight with the music she has delivered.

                <img src="https://www.ubetoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/top-10-south-african-female-djs-2022_10_18_15_17_45-ubetoo.jpg" alt="">
                <p>We didn’t know how much we needed Uncle Waffles until she showed up. Waffles first went viral, and then she stayed viral. Everyone knows how hard it is to achieve that. After going viral, Waffles began scoring gigs and performing among the continent’s most prominent artists and DJs. She is known for her energetic live gigs where she does not only entertain with the music but also with dance. She released her debut EP, “Red Dragon,” which hit the top of the charts and spawned the hit song “Tanzania.”

                <p>One thing we love about Lady Du is the fact that she never relents from telling her story. According to her, she did not always have things rosy in her career.
