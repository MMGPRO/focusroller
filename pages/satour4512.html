        <h3>Capes of South Africa </h3>
        <img src="https://bookaweb.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/assets/631b0087cea6a.jpg" alt="">
        <p>A cape is a mountainous point of land that extends into the water, like oceans and seas. They can be formed in different ways due to the movements of rivers or erosion. Some of them are even considered heritage sites by UNESCO, like the Cape Floristic Region. South Africa is famous for its capes, which are pretty popular among tourists. This part will show you some of the capes worth seeing.</p>

        <h3>Cape Peninsula - Flora and fauna like nowhere else in the world</h3>
        <img src="https://bookaweb.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/assets/631606cb02367.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Cape Peninsula is a mountainous peninsula that sticks out into the Atlantic Ocean on the southwestern side of the African continent. A big part of the peninsula belongs to the Table Mountain national park, one of Africa's most beautiful national parks. This place has a rich biodiversity, and the vegetation mostly consists of fynbos plants, a belt of natural bushes unique to this area. This place is home to different animal species, including lizards, tortoises, snakes, and porcupines, but the most common mammal you can find here are dassies. Unfortunately, some species are endangered or no longer exist due to human impact. In the southern part of the peninsula, there is the Cape of Good Hope, a famous tourist destination in South Africa.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Cape of Good Hope - The stuff of myths and legends </h3>
        <img src="https://bookaweb.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/assets/6316076b596e0.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Cape of Good Hope is known as the southernmost point of the African continent, and it truly is among the most beautiful places in South Africa. Originally called the Cape of Storm, due to rough tides and harsh weather, the Cape was discovered by Bartolomeu Dias in 1488. The rocky terrain of this place is a popular hiking spot for tourists, and numerous yacht races and bike contests are organized annually. There are legends and stories that surround the Cape Of God Hope. It is known as the Graveyard of ships, as the storm and tides caused many shipwrecks. Myths speak about the Flying Dutchmen, a story that has been portrayed many times in movies and books; there are also legends about mermaids and sea monsters believed to be spotted on the Cape. </p>

        <h3>Cape Agulhas - A place where two oceans meet</h3>
        <img src="https://bookaweb.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/assets/6316080c47bda.jpg" alt="">
        <p>According to National Hydrographic Organization, here is the beginning of the dividing line between the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. Technically, you can put one foot in the Indian Ocean and the other in the Atlantic Ocean at the same time. Pretty cool, right? This Cape is also a hazard for ships, as the freak waves and storms are responsible for many shipwrecks in this area. Probably, the most popular tourist spot on Cape Agulhas is the red and white lighthouse at the top of the hill. On the west side of it, there is the Agulhas National Park. We should also mention that this is a wine-producing region with long and fruity vineyards. Go for a swim at Struisbai or bike your way through the rocky terrain of the Cape; we are sure you'll love it. </p>

        <img src="https://bookaweb.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/assets/6316087d1dba1.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Did you know that South Africa has 11 official languages? And that it has three capital cities? In this part, we will explore some of Africa's most populated and lively cities. Let's get to know where are the best beaches and what attractions you can visit. <br>
        <b>Cape Town - Every wine lover's paradise </b> <br>
        Cape Town is the second largest city in South Africa and one of the three capital cities. Numerous bitches, diverse wildlife, and plenty of greenery make this city so spectacular. Go hiking on Table Mountain, feel the warm sand of Camps' Bay beach, or visit the Cape Winelands to have a taste of the finest wine in the world. Take a stroll along the waterfront boardwalk, and you will spot whales swimming in the ocean, or penguins wiggling around the beach. This city is packed with food markets, bars, and world-class restaurants, and the vibrant nightlife is truly unforgettable.

        <h3>Johannesburg - The largest city in South Africa</h3>
        <img src="https://bookaweb.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/assets/631608fb489f9.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Despite its reputation and turbulent history, the city is slowly growing in popularity as a tourist spot, and for a reason. You can enjoy numerous tourist attractions and activities in the biggest city in South Africa. To get the bigger picture of the city's background, we recommend you visit the establishments like The Apartheid Museum, a symbol of the oppression of the people of color and their fight for justice, and the Consitution Hill, a symbol of freedom. Despite the dark history, Johannesburg is one of the top places to visit if you love good nightlife and popular music: there are plenty of bars, restaurants, and clubs all over the city. Animal lovers can book a tour of Lion and Safari park to see and pet different animals native to this area, like lions, giraffes, and cheetahs. </p>

        <img src="https://bookaweb.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/assets/631afb288b32c.jpg" alt="">
        <p>As one of the three capitals of South Africa, Pretoria serves as the host to all foreign embassies. This is where the executive branch of government takes place. It's a city of gardens and parks, and if you decide to visit in the spring, you'll see how the whole city turns purple when the jacaranda trees are in full bloom. Attractions that we recommend you visit in Pretoria are the Voortrekker Monument, a granite structure raised to commemorate the Voortrekkers, and Freedom park, a memory of those killed during the World Wars and South African War. For animal lovers, we suggest visiting the National Zoological Garden of South Africa and The Rietvlei Nature Reserve.</p>

        <p>Located on the southern coast of the Western Cape province of South Africa, this city is most famous for whale watching. Yes, people do come here only to watch Southern right whales swim in the ocean and admire the beauty of these gentle giants. The peak season for this activity is from winter to spring, from June to December. People here love whales so much that they established The Whale House Museum used for education and scientific purposes. During the mating season of the whales, Hermanus hosts a Whale Festival in honor of the marine wildlife. </p>

This park is home to 2000 plant species and the Big 5 of South Africa (lions, elephants, rhinos, leopards, and buffalo). It's important to mention that in order to preserve traditional animal migration patterns, the fences between the borders of South Africa and Mozambique were removed, connecting Kruger Park and Limpopo Park together. In this park, plenty of Safari tours are available for you, from affordable group Safaris to exclusive private ones.</p>

Nature is capable of creating wonders, and the tufa waterfall known as Kadishi waterfall is no exception. This phenomenon is also known as The weeping face of nature due to the rocks being formed in a way that represents a face, and the waterfall falling over them gives an impression of tears. </p>
