    <h1>MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACES AROUND THE WORLD</h1>
</div>
<section class="">
    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Machu Picchu</h3>
        <img src="/images/machu4912.jpg" alt="">
        <p>This World Heritage site is easily the most famous spot in Peru, and for good reason. The ancient terraced city’s astounding architecture and sweeping views of the surrounding mountains will leave you breathless (as might the nearly 8,000 foot elevation.)</p>
    </div>


    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Great Ocean Road, Australia</h3>
        <img src="/images/great0018.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Head west from Melbourne on this coastal drive to see everything from the famous 12 Apostle rock formations, to koalas in Great Otway National Park as well as the charming seaside town of Lorne.</p>
    </div>



    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Pamukkale, Turkey</h3>
        <img src="/images/pamukkale7796.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Put every infinity pool you’ve ever seen to shame with these natural, snow-white hot springs overlooking the nearby city of Denizli. On top of the picturesque soak, Pamukkale is also home to the impressively preserved ruins of the ancient Roman spa-city Hierapolis where you can bathe like an emperor among the submerged centuries-old columns.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Japan in Cherry Blossom Season</h3>
        <img src="/images/japan8752.jpg" alt="">
        <p>While Japan is beautiful year-round, the few weeks each spring when cherry trees across the country explode with blossoms is a particularly pretty time to visit.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Banff National Park, Canada</h3>
        <img src="/images/banff4552.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The glacial lakes in Canada's first national park have some of the bluest water you've ever seen. Even if you're not particularly outdoorsy, you can still admire the views from one of the cozy and luxurious lakeside lodges throughout the park, like the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Pitons, St Lucia</h3>
        <img src="/images/lucia442101.jpg" alt="">
        <p>These two volcanic mountains are one of the most recognizable—not to mention beautiful—features on this Caribbean island. Enjoy the Pitons from the pristine white sand beach at Sugar Beach, A Viceroy Resort.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Marrakesh, Morocco</h3>
        <img src="/images/marrakech41010.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Located at the foot of the Atlas Mountains, Marrakesh has changed little since the Middle Ages. You could spend days here wandering around maze-like alleyways discovering the city's colorful souks, palaces and gardens.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Bora Bora, French Polynesia</h3>
        <img src="/images/bora47522.jpg" alt="">
        <p>With turquoise lagoons, coral reefs and overwater bungalows, this small island in the South Pacific is basically heaven on Earth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Oia, Santorini, Greece</h3>
        <img src="/images/santorini47855.jpg" alt="">
        <p>All of the Greek islands are undeniably beautiful, but head to the hillside town of Oia for some of the best views of the bright blue Aegean Sea.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Mù Cang Chải, Vietnam</h3>
        <img src="/images/hbz45120015.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Get off the beaten path in this rural district where the rice paddy-terraced mountains and twisting streams will make you feel like you’re living in a fairy tale.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Venice, Italy
        </h3>
        <img src="/images/italy441025.jpg" alt="">
        <p>If traversing the canals with a be-striped gondolier sounds unbearably touristy, stick to the sidewalks and spectacular arched bridges to get your fill of this truly unique, wildly romantic floating city.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Tamil Nadu, India</h3>
        <img src="/images/tamil4510012.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Most travelers head to North India for its Mughal palaces and forts, but the Southern state of Tamil Nadu is where most of the country's major Hindu temples are found, including the brightly-colored Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple seen here and the Meenakshi Temple Complex, which is so large it's considered a mini-city.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Torres del Paine National Park, Chile</h3>
        <img src="/images/mirador4418996.jpg" alt="">
        <p>If you're looking to get off the grid, head to Chile's Patagonia region for some of the most beautiful mountain views you'll ever see.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Forbidden City, Beijing, China</h3>
        <img src="/images/china100178.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Located in the center of Beijing, the Forbidden City was the imperial palace of China's emperors for five centuries and is one of the most beautifully preserved examples of ancient Chinese architecture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Amalfi Coast, Italy</h3>
        <img src="/images/7458italy.jpg" alt="">
        <p>There are so many beautiful places in Italy it's hard to pick just one—but the Amalfi Coast's idyllic hillside towns, like Positano, bump it to the top of our must-see list.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Krabi, Thailand</h3>
        <img src="/images/thailand401256.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Located on southern Thailand's west coast, this province's coastline is dotted with limestone cliffs and hundreds of islands just offshore in the Andaman Sea, making it one of the world's most popular beach vacation destinations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Fiordland National Park, New Zealand</h3>
        <img src="/images/newzealand412968.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Each year starting in the end of November and peaking in early December, fields of bright purple Russell Lupins bloom across New Zealand's South Island. One of the most beautiful spots to go Lupin-spotting is in Fiordland National Park, home to the equally gorgeous Milford Sound.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Bagan, Myanmar</h3>
        <img src="/images/myanmar785236.jpg" alt="">
        <p>This ancient city in central Myanmar is made up of thousands (yes, thousands) of Buddhist temples and pagodas. One of the prettiest views is from above—we recommend going for a hot air balloon ride at sunrise.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Havasu Falls, Arizona</h3>
        <img src="/images/havasu02589.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Before you can swim in these beautiful blue-green waters located near Grand Canyon National Park, you have to hike ten miles to get there. Trust us, it's totally worth the trek.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Zhangye Danxia Geopark, China</h3>
        <img src="/images/zhangye452698.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Geology lovers and avid Instagrammers alike will be drawn to the otherworldly hues of the "Rainbow Mountains." The colors were formed by the layering of sedimentary mineral deposits over millions of years, but it's hard to look at the flowing reds, yellows, and oranges and not feel like you're witnessing magic.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe and Zambia</h3>
        <img src="/images/victoria423698.webp" alt="">
        <p>One of the seven natural wonders of the world, Victoria Falls spans the Zimbabwe and Zambia borders. "The smoke that thunders," as it is known to locals, and its surroundings, are hubs for white-water rafting, helicopter rides, big-game safaris, and other thrilling adventures.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Uyuni Salt Flat, Bolivia</h3>
        <img src="/images/salar458896.webp" alt="">
        <p>The world's largest salt flat covers 4,000 square miles of the Bolivian Altiplano. In the dry season, it's an endless white sheet of salt tiles made all the more dazzling by clear, sunny skies. From December to April, however, regular rains create a mirror effect that merges lake and sky. No matter when you see it, Salar de Uyuni is one of the most captivating sights on earth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Hạ Long Bay, Vietnam</h3>
        <img src="/images/vietnam456332.webp" alt="">
        <p>With hundreds of jungle-covered karsts springing out of emerald green waters, Hạ Long Bay is a photographer's dream. Hop on a boat or kayak to explore the UNESCO World Heritage Site's beautiful islands and surreal cave systems.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Le Morne Brabant, Mauritius</h3>
        <img src="/images/mauritius47896322.webp" alt="">
        <p>A freestanding basaltic mountain hulking over a bright blue-green Indian Ocean lagoon certainly makes spectacular scenery. When viewed from above, the surrounding sand and silt form an optical illusion that appears to be a massive underwater waterfall at this mythic place. Thanks to its isolation and near-inaccessibility, Le Morne sheltered people who escaped enslavement during the 18th and early 19th centuries.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Railay West Beach, Thailand</h3>
        <img src="/images/westbeach487995.webp" alt="">
        <p>On the Railay peninsula's west side, Krabi's famous karsts meet a simply stunning jade-green lagoon. The vertical cliffs block access from the Krabi mainland, making Railay reachable only by boat, adding to its incredible appeal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Dead Sea, Jordan, Palestine, and Israel</h3>
        <img src="/images/deadsea4789900.webp" alt="">
        <p>Name aside, the Dead Sea is a lake and one of the world's saltiest, at that (in fact, the saline water has such a high density that it keeps bathers afloat). Set between Jordan, Palestine, and Israel at the Earth's lowest elevation, it's known for its beautiful clear and tranquil waters (nearly 10 times more saline than the ocean) and surrounding mineral formations, sandy beaches, nature preserves, natural pools, and waterfalls.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Table Mountain, Cape Town</h3>
        <img src="/images/table789553.webp" alt="">
        <p>Ascending iconic Table Mountain tops the list for most travelers in Cape Town. Adventurous hikers can go on foot, but there's also an aerial cableway that gently sweeps up to the 3,563-foot summit. Either way, the top offers insane panoramic views of the South African capital and the Atlantic.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Iguazu Falls, Argentina and Brazil</h3>
        <img src="/images/BRAZIL7489995.webp" alt="">
        <p>Altogether, the 275 cascades on the Argentina-Brazil border form a mind-blowing, panoramic waterfall. The overwhelming sight, combined with the sound and energy of water rushing at up to 450,000 cubic feet per second in the rainy season, is pure magnificence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Matira Beach, French Polynesia</h3>
        <img src="/images/matira99741256.webp" alt="">
        <p>The South Pacific calls up many visions of spectacular beaches. Bora Bora's Matira Beach gets singled out for its miles of pearly white, flour-fine sand and breathtaking bright turquoise lagoon.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Cirque de Gavarnie, France</h3>
        <img src="/images/cirque452569.webp" alt="">
        <p>Cirque de Gavarnie is a popular hiking destination in the Pyrenees, and one of its most beautiful. Called "the colosseum of nature" by Victor Hugo, the Cirque is a ring of sheer granite mountain walls enclosing a picture-perfect green valley. It's astounding even before you add in three-tier Gavarnie Falls pouring over a 922-foot drop.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Shark Bay, Australia</h3>
        <img src="/images/shark78201233.webp" alt="">
        <p>Shark Bay: where the red earth of Australia's westernmost point meets the teal waters of the Indian Ocean. The bay is home to one of the largest and richest beds of seagrass in the world, as well as stromatolites — rocky-looking, cauliflower-shaped microbial reefs and some of the oldest life forms on Earth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="beat45788">
        <h3>Lofoten Islands, Norway</h3>
        <img src="/images/lofoten778562233.webp" alt="">
        <p>The Lofoten archipelago bursts dramatically out of the Norwegian Sea. Between the jagged peaks and steep slopes are quaint fishing villages, secluded coves, scenic backpacking and biking trails, and dreamy white-sand beaches.</p>
