            Kaizer Chiefs’ in-form winger Pule Mmodi has received a Bafana Bafana call-up among three players drafted by coach Hugo Broos after another spate of injuries as the squad assembled on Sunday and Monday for this month’s two friendlies.  <br> <br>
            Mamelodi Sundowns’ attacking midfielder Themba Zwane, midfield clubmate Teboho Mokoena and Swedish-based midfielder Luke Le Roux are the latest injuries for the games against Namibia on Saturday (3pm) and Democratic Republic of the Congo on September 12, both at Orlando Stadium.  <br> <br>
            Burnley striker Lyle Foster was in camp and arrived for Monday’s training at FNB Stadium, entering the tunnel area chatting to captain Ronwen Williams.  <br>
            Broos said Mmodi is the replacement for Zwane, Bulky TS Galaxy midfielder Mlungisi Mbunjana has been called up in place of Mokoena, and Portuguese Liga 2 side Tondela’s Sphephelo Sithole replaces Le Roux.  <br> <br>
            “It’s a strange camp because we have seven injuries [in total],” Broos said.  <br> <br>
            “[Khuliso] Mudau was injured but OK, he played on Saturday [for Sundowns against Kaizer Chiefs], which we did not know he would — nobody informed us about that.  <br> <br>
            “We have [Themba] Zwane, [Bongokuhle] Hlongwane, [Thapelo] Maseko, [Thapelo] Morena and now [Teboho] Mokoena injured. So we have a lot.  <br> <br>
            “And I’m not happy about that because these games are preparation for the Afcon [Africa Cup of Nations finals in January and February] and for the World Cup qualifiers in November. And OK, that can happen, but it’s at a bad moment.  <br> <br>
            “It means we have to change the team in seven places when you compare it to the selection against Morocco [Bafana’s 2-1 shock Nations Cup qualifying win at FNB Stadium] three months ago. <br> <br>
            “I hoped to have, with maybe just a few changes, the same combination that played against Morocco.  <br> <br>
            “There is also a good side to that situation in that it means we will call in other players and they will get game-time. That is a goal of these two friendly games — to give game-time to every player called up. So the new players here will have game-time.” <br> <br>
            Broos said, among his foreign brigade, apart from Foster Al Ahly’s Percy Tau had also arrived.  <br>
            Mihlali Mayambela of Aris Limassol in Cyprus and Strasbourg’s Lebo Mothiba are due to arrive on Tuesday morning.  <br> <br>
            Bafana play two more friendly matches against Eswatini (October 13) and Ivory Coast (October 17) before their opening World Cup qualifying group C qualifier at home to Benin in November.
